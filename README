NAME
    RT::Extension::RepliesToResolved - intercept replies to resolved tickets

DESCRIPTION
    Intercepts replies via email to resolved tickets and creates a new
    ticket rather than updates resolved ticket. There are a few reasons to
    do this:

    "Thank you" messages re-open tickets and mess with statistics.
    People keep sending new questions into old tickets.
