NAME
    RT::Extension::RepliesToResolved - intercept replies to resolved tickets

DESCRIPTION
    Intercepts replies via email to resolved tickets and creates a new
    ticket rather than updates resolved ticket. There are a few reasons to
    do this:

    "Thank you" messages re-open tickets and mess with statistics.
    People keep sending new questions into old tickets.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        Only run this the first time you install this module.

        If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

        If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions
        in case changes need to be made to your database.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::RepliesToResolved));

        or add "RT::Extension::RepliesToResolved" to your existing @Plugins
        line.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
    Configuration for this extension is defined in

        /opt/rt4/local/plugins/RT-Extension-RepliesToResolved/etc/RepliesToResolved_Config.pm

    You can read about the options in that file and then set your own
    options in your RT_SiteConfig.pm file.

    By default, after 7 days, this module will intercept mail to resolved
    tickets and force the creation of a new ticket. It then creates a
    RefersTo link between the two tickets. Each of these (time, statuses,
    link) is configurable.
