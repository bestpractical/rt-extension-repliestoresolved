=head1 NAME

RT::Extension::RepliesToResolved - intercept replies to resolved tickets

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Intercepts replies via email to resolved tickets, and creates a new
ticket rather than updating the resolved ticket.  There are a few
reasons to do this:

=over 4

=item "Thank you" messages re-open tickets and mess with statistics.

=item People keep sending new questions into old tickets.

=head1 INSTALLATION

=over

=item C<perl Makefile.PL>

=item C<make>

=item C<make install>

May need root permissions

=item C<make initdb>

Only run this the first time you install this module.

If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data
in your database.

If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions
in case changes need to be made to your database.

=item Edit your F</opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm>

If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

    Plugin('RT::Extension::RepliesToResolved');

For RT 4.0, add this line:

    Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::RepliesToResolved));

or add C<RT::Extension::RepliesToResolved> to your existing C<@Plugins> line.

=item Clear your mason cache

    rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

=item Restart your webserver

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Configuration for this extension is defined in

    /opt/rt4/local/plugins/RT-Extension-RepliesToResolved/etc/RepliesToResolved_Config.pm

You can read about the options in that file and then set your own
options in your RT_SiteConfig.pm file.

By default, after 7 days, this module will intercept mail to resolved
tickets and force the creation of a new ticket. It then creates a
RefersTo link between the two tickets. Each of these (time, statuses,
link) is configurable.
